Thanks everyone! I think Ill just leave the downstairs to him &amp; go to bed. Some people arent happy about this post, I think. Ill get dinner before work or something. 

Thank you for the perspectives! Now I know that if I do happen to walk in on him its probably not that big of a deal. I appreciate the advice!

-

I ask because I really want to eat breakfast, but dad is downstairs doing his morning routine, which includes laying in front of the tv in the living room watching vids his wife has no idea he watches. 

Personally, I dont care. I already bailed him out of having his iPad jacked by illicit websites. 

But the thing is, this isnt something my family discusses out in the open. I have to work a night shift so I want to sleep soon, and hes hijacking the lower floor with his poon media. 

I want to just go down to the kitchen, which is in clear los of the living room, and make my breakfast&but I dont want to give him a crisis. 

For the record, Im early 30s and dad is ~70. 

Anyone have any advice on how to handle this with diplomacy? Will it be really humiliating for him if he feels like hes caught in the act, or wont he care?",AskMen,25,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMen/comments/uq3am1/how_embarrassing_is_it_to_be_caught_watching/,eating

2022-10-12,1665598651,"Men of Reddit, what unexpected thing did you learn about your dad?","I'll try to keep this concise, but it's probably going to be a lengthy read. 

So, my (M47) dad and I have a perfectly bland relationship. He lives five hours away and rarely makes the effort to reach out to any of his seven kids. Which was fine with me, I was content with seeing him once every year or two when he would drive out to my area to visit his brother. Though, it was frustrating to tell him to give me a shout when he was in town so we could have dinner or lunch and then I'd find out a couple weeks later from my uncle that my dad had just visited him and gone home already.

Then about 15 years or so ago, my dad was diagnosed with Parkinson's. It was caught early enough that he was able to get on a medication regimen that kept him pretty stable. Unfortunately he is now nearing 70 and his health and cognitive function are declining rapidly. In February of 2021, my brother and I made emergency journeys to the town where he lives, because he'd called the police due to hallucinations he was having (medication related) and they found a bunch of old rifles and shotguns which he didn't have permits for. So I was contacted by the police, which cued my brother and I to come out. Essentially we had to clean and organize his home because it was a pigsty and cluttered and unsafe for him to walk around in. A key moment here is that dad was adamant that we stay out of his bedroom. Which we mostly respected, but I poked my head in just to assess. It wasn't any worse than anywhere else, mostly piles of laundry and books and cameras everywhere.

Jump forward to the beginning of Sept 2022 and I get a call from my sister that dad was found unconscious in his bathroom by a friend and taken to hospital. I spend the next two weeks talking with my sister, the hospital, social workers, home care workers, etc., as we try to figure out what is going to happen with my dad next. Home support workers won't go to his house because it is unsafe due to clutter. The hospital won't discharge him without supports in place. But also, he can't be in the hospital anymore because, medically, he doesn't need to be there. What a fuckin' catch 22 that was. He ends up in a local hotel for a week and I drive myself and two uncles out and we blitz clean his place in two days to get him home.

Here's where the weirdness (for me) comes in. I end up being the one to clean my dad's bedroom and en suite bathroom. I am finding weird amounts of women's clothing, but my dad's second wife left him almost 20 years ago and he's been single ever since. There are bras on the back of the bathroom door. All sorts of women's underwear, sports tops, long skirts and such mixed in with all the laundry on the floor. I found one pair of padded shorts, the kind that looks like it's meant to make your butt look big. A lot of the stuff I'm finding is waaaay too small to fit my dad. He's like 6'2"" and probably 240lbs. I'm thinking, maybe some of this stuff is from when my half-sisters lived there and he was just jumbling all the laundry together? But no, that can't be it. I'm also finding lots of period supplies in the form of pads. Now, this I could kind of excuse because his Parkinson's, or maybe just age, resulted in some incontinence. Maybe he was using these before he got the full leak proof undergarments? I also considered that when he was shopping he was just confused and maybe buying things for his daughters, even though they'd moved out. Or some of it could be comfort stuff. Wearing an enormous women's sleeper t-shirt around your house because all you are doing is watching TV and eating ice cream isn't that odd. Or maybe he just didn't know what the heck he was buying. He seems to have done a lot of shopping - dozens of cameras, handheld consoles, DVDs, toys, books.... a collector's ~~dream~~ nightmare.

Then, I find it. In his closet there's a big plastic tub. I open it up to see what random toys or treasure he's stuffed in here - cameras or old books, or gaming consoles.... ? No, it's more underwear. And here's the kicker; there's a manila envelope in there, kinda bulgey and soft. I open it up and there's more underwear in there, this with the tags on. The Delta Burke Collection. The envelope has my dad's name and mailing address on it, so he clearly mail-ordered this women's underwear.

This whole time, my dad is kind of hanging out with us, making sure we don't throw his ""treasures"" away. At one point I mention, ""Dad, you have a *lot* of women's clothes around here, can we send them all to the thrift shop?"" ""You sure can,"" he replies. My uncles both mentioned it too, but he didn't address it. 

So I'm really left wondering - was my dad dressing in this stuff or were they just masturbation aids? Ultimately, it doesn't matter to me why he had the stuff. Whatever his kink was doesn't actually bother me and as far as I can tell he wasn't hurting anyone with what he was doing. 

But I will say, this really threw me for a loop. As I mentioned, my dad was a bigger guy. Always had a beard, worked in forestry and mills his whole life. Active in his union, loved playing softball, interested in cars and trucks. Collected comics and sci-fi and fantasy magazines from the 40s through to current. Tinkered with cameras and videogames. To me he was always kind of this big nerd, far from a guy that maybe wore a bra for fun when he was alone. My brothers and I are all very similar to him, so it is *so* strange to me to think of my dad - my dad! - dressing up in bras and panties or whatever he was doing with all this stuff. I know it's probably hard for all of us to think of our parents in terms of being sexual people. I remember when I was a teen after my parents got divorced and hearing my dad have sex with his girlfriend (who eventually became the mother of my half-sisters and brother), which chased me down to my bedroom where I cranked up some music. To think that aside from that he was engaging in some sort of kink play really did my head in, in a way that I guess I just wasn't expecting. 

That's my story. I found out my dad is (probably) into women's underwear in a kinky way and it was kind of shocking to me.

2023-01-27,1674794601,How have you former athletes been able to change your eating habits?,"I used to play a fairly high level of sport all the way up to the college level and stopped in 2018 once I graduated. Since then, I have still felt the same amount of hunger despite not expending as mamy calories, which makes it hard to try and adjust to a lower calorie intake. I have tried different things like intermittent fasting, larger less frequent meals, smaller more frequent meals/snacks, etc., and it seems that I don't feel satiated and just end up eating the same after a few weeks.

I am still somewhat active, so I haven't gained an agregious amount of weight, but even still would like to hear what others have had success for resolving similar issues.

As much as I would like to be more active and hit the gym, between the day job, side hustle, and young family I don't really have the time right now to do so, so the ""just be more active again"" resolution is one for further down the road",AskMen,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMen/comments/10mccb4/how_have_you_former_athletes_been_able_to_change/,eating

Pretty much the title. I sweat when I sleep - doesn't matter the temperature of the house, how many layers of clothing I have on (if any) or how many fans I have blasting on me - I will ALWAYS turn into a human furnace and overheat and begin to sweat.

I'm not over weight, I exercise regularly and eat relatively healthy.

I am in a pretty rigid weight loss deal right now. Eating in a deficit and working out about 5 days a week. Hard workouts. 

My question is should I wait til the weight is gone to date again? Obviously looks are important. Im not an idiot to that fact. But I am getting quite lonely. And want a family. And Im 30 now.

Also, I want to clarify that I am not...out of shape or discusting in any way lol. I have a skin care routing, I eat well, exercise, etc. It's just that I wanted to grow out my beard and have it be full. I Just don't know how to get it in shape on my own.

So I have a long beard. I am thinking about trimming it a little bit. Not like with a razer but with scissors because I don't want to have a stubble beard or anything like that. I want to have a well maintained and full beard.

My question is this: Where can I start? I was thinking about going to a barber that does beard trimming and ask them if they can teach me to maintain it myself, but I think that may be a bit weird...

Is there some sort of grooming kit I can buy? I searched some online but some guys say no, some say yes to various companies. I don't want to waste money on something that's going to be garbage.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Next, I have a few questions about maintaining the...downstairs department...

I have never done anything in that area before because I am very scared about causing any damage. Like...this quite literally traumatizes me which is why I refuse to put a damn blade down there. I also don't have my Dad with me at the moment because he is in another state and we don't really talk about this even when he's home.

So I have a few questions about this.

1. What do I use? What is required to maintain that area extremely well?
2. If I have never trimmed down there before, and I get rid of everything, will it be very sharp and prickly? Honestly, I don't want it to feel that way at all.
3. What will happen if I grow it out again after trimming/shaving completely? Will it be the same?
4. Like in the first part of this post with the beard, is there any grooming kits that you guys can recommend?

I greatly appreciate any advice you all can give me. I will probably have more questions but I will make a post if I do lol. Thanks!",AskMen,24,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMen/comments/wl96so/how_do_i_begin_male_grooming_and_personal_hygiene/,eating

The money I make from freelancing is basically all we touch right now. A good percentage of our money from work is saved. Which let me tell you, it works really well, but man is it tiring.

Was off work for 2 weeks while waiting for this new job. Now that I'm back working since Monday my body is mad at me. On my last job I was able to work out most mornings before work.

He came back and our conversations felt strained, he had this sense of mild superiority over me and would say he would guard me and the family and stuff about duty. When our grandpa died last year I was the first person he hugged and leaned on, I held it together (when I really wanted to fall apart) to be there for him. Went to the bathroom for a solid 20min just weeping and slapped myself a couple of times to get it together. I did my best to be there and take care of my grandma, mother, and my cousin. I really thought wed come closer together after this tragedy but he became distant again when he left. A few days after the funeral he was over at my parents house he was eating with my grandma and my little sister (shes 3, its a long story) and I decided to take a picture of them eating together since its been years from the last photo.

2022-09-16,1663339367,How can I improve my lifestyle as a 30 yo man who works 9-5 job?,"Hello Reddit,

I'm looking for tips to improve my lifestyle since I feel that I'm kinda stagnating and I lack motivation lately.

I'm 30 years old, I live with my parents but that's normal where I'm from since I'm not married. My wedding was scheduled next month but a couple of months ago my fiancee and I realized we're not getting along and decided it's better for the both of us to break up, she was my first romance but it was arranged and kinda forced and was going nowhere (I actually felt a bit relieved when we did break up)

I work a desk job as a software engineer for one of the market that I really love and I'm getting paid really well. Work environment is great and friendly and I feel like I belong there. For 7 years after my graduation I made my name in the company and they're relying on me for leading a lot of activity and I'm proud of keeping the ""work-life balance"" intact as I work only during the work hours and leave on time everyday, almost never working weekends unless it's absolutely necessary.

I have only a couple of friends outside work who were actually my coworkers in the early years before they sought work elsewhere, we occasionally meet up on weekends but other than that my social life revolves around my family. I see myself as an introvert since I don't like being at social events, and the like. Only exception is going out with friends on the occasional gathering.

My family was a bit over protective when I was young so I didn't play any ""contact sports"", eventually I didn't really play any sports since I prefer mind-challenging stuff and video games and I picked up a keyboard (the one like a piano not the computer one) and had a friend teach me in middle school. 4 years ago I picked up a classical guitar and it really helped pass the time during the lockdown, and I also plan to pick up an electric to play more stuff that I like. This type of lifestyle led to me being a bit obese but not much, I look really sharp and nice in a suit dor example and my body is fine except for a big stomach that I carried with me since 5th grade.

Lately, specially since the Covid lockdown and the year I spent engaged to a girl I didn't really like, I feel that I'm not motivated anymore. I used to pull all-nighters on my PlayStation and feel energetic even though I have been working all day and driving a total of 2 hours per day to and from work. But now I'm just procrastinating everything. I have a french course that I signed up for and watched only one session. I have 10 games on my backlog that I didn't even touch. I went for a walk last week for 25 minutes and that was the best morning in my life in a while, but I feel too lazy to try it out again. That was the only exercise I had in the last two months. Whenever I try to lose weight my mom feels that I'm not ""eating well"" and tempts me back to meals she knows I like and I quickly lose interest in losing weight, specially that I put on like one Kg a year or so and not much.


The reason I'm writing this post is that I want to get better or feel that I have energy again. Last week I told a friend jokingly that it's time to retire and it hit me that I feel almost the same vibes my father feels (he just retired btw) but I am still too young for this. Now that you know almost every thing about my life, I'm curious to know if you've been there yourself or if you have tips to help me make progress in my life not just at work.",AskMen,16,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMen/comments/xft7aw/how_can_i_improve_my_lifestyle_as_a_30_yo_man_who/,eating

2022-10-05,1664998161,"Trust Issues, what would you do?","So.. youre sitting on the sofa with the love of your life. 10 years together and you couldnt be happier. Her phone is on the sofa between you and it beeps. You look down and see the name of her ex (who she isnt in contact with since youve been together as far as youre aware) appear before the notification disappears. You say nothing and she ignores the phone for a few minutes. 
She then picks it up and comments that a mutual friend commented on her Insta post (as if that was the message that came in). You say, oh did that just come in? Yes, she says. 

What would you do?

EDIT: Thank you for all the responses, especially the sensible ones and in particular the one who I spoke to privately. For those interested heres how it played out. 

I left it a day to see give her the chance to say if something needed to be said. It was eating me up and she could tell, so when she asked what was wrong I said& I thought I saw your exs name appear on your phone, but you said otherwise and its bugging me. She knew I had seen it and lied in the moment to not spoil the evening. 

Turns out she bumped into him randomly two days ago and he has since messaged her to meet for coffee. She knew I wouldnt be happy so didnt say anything, though had not planned to meet up with him. 

We talked honestly and ironed out a few things that werent really problems but we both compensated for. Ultimately there are always differing perspectives based on our experiences. What I viewed as lying, she viewed as protecting me, because she never intended to meet up with him. 

Perhaps I could be more trusting that if she did want to meet him, thats ok. And perhaps she should not be hiding / protecting me from things like this. Looks bad if found out later. But also, who wants deal with someone over reacting?!

2022-03-29,1648563616,Boyfriend doesn't stay hard during sex. How do I approach this topic ?,"So when my boyfriend (37) and I (22) have sex we are both really into it. Foreplay and everything. 
He also tells me how he loves having sex with me and that it has never felt this good. He is pretty talkative in general and it's nice to hear. He also said that he needs to get his feelings off of chest which is not a problem. 
The issue is that sometimes he goes soft (not fully just a little bit) and he also has a hard time coming. He usually comes when I'm on top but he mostly uses his hand. I feel super insecure and I often can't concentrate on making myself come (or enjoying myself) because I think about wanting to make HIM come. He is also super focused on making me come before him. Sometimes (if I can lol) even multiple time. 
I am just so exhausted thinking about what I'm doing wrong but he says it's not me. 
How do I approach him about this ?

EDIT: So many people have commented their thoughts and opinions on this topic (some in an incredibly rude way) and I just wanted to add a few things :) 
We are both from Germany so the ""bad cop"" image some (probably Americans) try to push onto him is unnecessary. I am not saying we don't have bad cops but in Germany you have to go through a 3 year training and the exams are super hard. 
Both friends and family are very supportive of our relationship. Yes, even my dad. No I don't have daddy issues.

&amp;#x200B;

* I lift 3x per week. I also throw in cardio/core 1-2 times per week as well.
* Track calories with MyFitnessPal, currently running a target deficit of 500cals/day.
* Limiting alcohol intake as much as possible. I do still drink, but stick to mostly sparkling water or club soda as mixer. I pretty much never drink beer.
* On rest days, I try to walk around and stand up as much as possible (I work at a desk). I sometimes do a yoga flow as well.
* I avoid ""white"" carbs as much as possible (i.e. white bread, white rice). I don't typically eat these anyway. Same with drinking pop, I don't normally go out of my way to have it.
* Ensure I'm drinking water or green tea throughout the day.

Since the beginning of June I've dropped about 8lbs (I'm approximately 19% body fat). I'm seeing an ab-line starting to form, but there's still a bit of very stubborn fat that's shrinking but seems to be holding on for dear life.

My goal isn't really to be competition bodybuilder ripped per se, but maybe get down to about 10-12% body fat and maintain that. I have no plans to stop exercising and eating healthy when I get there. At that point I might try switching to ""maintenance"" calories.

As I was eating the steak, my buddys gf pointed out that Im cutting it with the wrong hand. Apparently its supposed to be with your non-dominant hand. 

Now, I know this. But honestly, ever since I was a kid, I just didnt see it as a big deal. Like, at all. Im like potato, potato. I find it easier to cut with my right, so thats what I do. But she looked so judgemental about it. It made me feel uncomfortable lol. Like I was being watched. 

And then, she also commented on how I was eating mashed potatoes? Apparently I was digging into it with my fork, when I should have been keeping its entire shape and kind of scooping it from the sides, instead of stabbing everywhere headfirst. 

Like thats just how I prefer to eat? Maybe its less delicate or orderly but its not like I make a mess around my face or chew with my mouth open. The only thing I can think of is how it might look on the plate? Like all squished up? Is that it? 

I use my right hand because its easier to cut and I just naturally eat mashed potatoes like that despite being shown otherwise. I didnt think it was read into this much.

My two guy friends didnt say anything about it ever, nor have they seemed to notice. Or maybe they did and just didnt bother saying anything? See now I dont know anymore.

didnt really fine dine with steak and mashed potatoes. I actually learned from a YouTube video but then decided it wasnt worth the effort to change this habit that I saw nothing wrong with.

-when i took him to the vet recently, they weighed him and he lost 30% of his body weight

-the vet said that my dogs body is slowly shutting down due to old age (thankfully no cancer or terminal illness like that found after several tests) the vet also said the decision to do anything regarding my dog is ultimately up to me, the dog owner, and that euthanizing is an option to prevent any further pain and suffering for my dog

-i just cant bring myself to decide to end my dogs life

-so. difficult!

-my dog being physically gone from my life feels like im losing a part of myself forever=-

Im absolutely devastated by the thought of my dogs death because weve been through so much together for so long. He really is my best friend. Long story short, because of rough circumstances, my dog is the only living entity who has always been there for me, and Ive always been there for him.

2022-11-29,1669729282,What do men think of the trend of people being more alone?,"See this article: [https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2022/11/23/americans-alone-thanksgiving-friends/](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2022/11/23/americans-alone-thanksgiving-friends/)

It seems... lots of people are alone, lonely and struggling. It seems everyday I look online people are struggling, feeling alone, looking for things to do.

For me: I graduated college in 2019, so while I avoided the pandemic disrupting it, during the pandemic lots of my friends moved apart. We didn't even have going away parties/night outs at the bar. So once we came out of the pandemic... I kind of have no one left. I just go to work, come home. If I want to feel just a little bit of joy, sometimes I eat out alone or something. It's draining and I don't know how to keep going.

But the real rub is... I reach out to people who post on my local nextdoor pages/sub reddits/online apps who say they are lonely/bored etc... and I never really get much of a follow through about actually doing something. It's... very discouraging.

So... errrr.... men.... what do you all think about this trend of everyone becoming more and more alone? How did you fix it?",AskMen,73,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMen/comments/z7uegx/what_do_men_think_of_the_trend_of_people_being/,eating

* In an argument, it's a lot easier to out-stupid someone than to outsmart them.

I love my 6 year old nephew to death, ive been there since the day he was born. I remember getting a text from my sisters ex that my sister was giving birth. I got there as quick as I could because I was just excited to be an uncle. His dad left him and my sister when he was 4 months and my sister filed a restraining order against him. Long story. 

I grew up without my dad because he died when I was 5/6 and even then he was traveling a lot because he was a humanitarian. My mum and older sister tell me he was a great person but unfortunately he died when I was little. And so I didnt really have a male role model in my life. All my uncles lived in another country, one of my older brothers tried to fill that role but hes only 2 years older than me so he wasnt really able to. Also and my oldest brother was into gangs etc so yeah. 

Ive always been there for my nephew and sister and its easier when theyre a baby/toddler because they dont know much they just wake up eat play sleep. My older brothers dont see him much so im basically the male he sees the most. When I was in university after class I would visit my sister to help babysit him. Ive been there in his life till today, But now my nephew is 6 I can see he looks up to me, he always calls me his bro and listens to me more than his mum sometimes and respects me more, when he does wrong I tell him off and I try to teach him right from wrong. If people saw my phone they would think hes my son, its just full of pictures and funny videos of him from when he was a baby until now. When its his birthday he automatically knows a big birthday present from me is incoming. We play video games, I read him books, help with homework, he watches football with me sometimes. I took him to watch 2 movies. All this sounds good but I realized when he gets around from age 8-9(im not sure when kids start really needing a male role model in their lifes) hes gonna be looking up to me even more and im a mess. I posted a post on here 2 months back but from January this year I started to really get my life together. I have a lot of issues to fix and I dont want my nephew realizing the person he looks up to is me. Im not a man atm and definitely not ready to be a father figure. 

The problem is my sister recently is living with me and my mum for a while and the house has a spare room and his school is only 15 mins away so hes going to be around me even more. I know as an uncle its not my responsibility but I know first hand whats it like growing up without a father or even an uncle and so I want the best for him. The thing im embarrassed about is being unemployed, all his friends have dads and ofc they work and I dont want him coming up to me and asking me what I do for work.

2022-04-01,1648815565,Men who started a family later in life (45+ yrs): Why did you wait so long to settle down? How did you find a partner? What obstacles did you have to overcome and sacrifices to make? Do you regret waiting so long?,"I'm (m) in my early/ mid thirties now and although I have had relationships in the past where I even considered a future together now I don't see myself settling down and starting a family anytime soon. I feel like I kind of wasted my twenties a bit doing things I was supposed to do but not things that I find truly fulfilling. I have discovered more of my true passion around 30 along with a big hunger for adventure and exploration.   


More and more I see that such a lifestyle makes it kinda difficult to maintain a committed relationship. Women around my age demographic are often looking for something serious, even to start a family. And rightly so, I don't want to stand in their way. But also I don't want to compromise.   


I know people who have a career and a family but having a father who was always working or too tired from work to do anything with his sons I feel that having kids and having a good relationship with them are two separate things. And I don't want my kids and partner to pay the price for me wanting to have my cake and eat it, too. So I feel it's only fair not to mislead anyone and stay on my own. Even though I do enjoy companionship and intimacy.

I have this idea that the best years of my life will be in mid 30s to early 40s. I think as men, that will be the peak or our lives if we play our cards right while young.

For example, getting educated and building a solid career oe business while young. Physically taking care of yourself while, so your body isn't falling apart in your 40s. As in good diet and exercise, don't excessively drink and do drugs. Around mid 30s to early 40s, your kids are growing up and your past the pain in the ass days caring for the babies. Now they are going to school and you get to teach them life lessons and do stuff with them. You got a good and comfortable house to live and raise your family.

I think If you build a good foundation for the rest of your life while young, the rest will just be coasting right through.

On the other hand, people in their twenties usually want to party, fuck, do drugs, destroy their body. Eat horrible diet because it's easy and convenient, not exercise because it takes too much time or whatever. Think if they are working it is ""working their life away"" and never put the effort into building a good career or their own business. What I'm talking about is this YOLO and FOMO culture where everybody things they gotta live it up while young or they will lose their youth. I think that will be very detrimental when they grow up and realize what they have done to their health. When in fact, it was their abuse that destroys their bodies in the later years. When if instead you have always taken care of yourself physically, you can be just as healthy in your 40s as you were at 25.

Basically I think that is a mid life crisis. When you hit 40 and realize all of the ""fun"" you had while young because you didn't want to waste your youth, was the exact opposite.

During basic training (ex military), I lost 30 lbs. in less than 2 months! I literally had no stomach, and my face was shriveled up to nothing.  But guess what? the freakin' love handles were still there. They were a bit smaller, but the shape didn't change at all.

Well now I am turning 33- my body aches (a lot of it is also due to the wear and tear from military service), I can't exercise like I used to but I try doing HIIT 10-15 minutes a day with a 20 minute lift session. The stomach ain't going no where, the love handles aren't either.

How did you guys get rid of them? Especially if your genetics and age play a factor?

I used to play sports almost every day, but since having a child (now 2.5 years) and with the pandemic, its been limited to 3 or so times a week with a few gym days in between and I go for walks on warmer days and in the summer (I live in Canada, eh).

Recently, Ive been finding that I just wake up and parts of my body are just sore AF. Like this morning I get up and both my ankles are screaming at me and idk know why. I have had some recurring past injuries from sports like my knees constantly being inflamed (I still play basketball, but not as much as before). 

Now Im not the healthiest eater. I do try to incorporate as much fruits and veggies as I can in my diet. But I do eat a lot of junk food (I know, Im trying to it down/out but its not easy). Ive tried doing stretches for its own sake as well.

To deal with the pain, I usually take an Advil and Ive experimented with weed edibles at night before bed to varying degrees of success. But I dont want to become reliant on substances to deal with these issues.

2022-10-06,1665059979,"Men, how old are you right now and what age do you think will or was the best time of your life?","I am 27 right now. I have this idea that the best years of my life will be in mid 30s to early 40s. I think as men, that will be the peak or our lives if we play our cards right while young.

For example, getting educated and building a solid career oe business while young. Physically taking care of yourself while, so your body isn't falling apart in your 40s. As in good diet and exercise, don't excessively drink and do drugs. Around mid 30s to early 40s, your kids are growing up and your past the pain in the ass days caring for the babies. Now they are going to school and you get to teach them life lessons and do stuff with them. You got a good and comfortable house to live and raise your family.

I think If you build a good foundation for the rest of your life while young, the rest will just be coasting right through.

On the other hand, people in their twenties usually want to party, fuck, do drugs, destroy their body. Eat horrible diet because it's easy and convenient, not exercise because it takes too much time or whatever. Think if they are working it is ""working their life away"" and never put the effort into building a good career or their own business. What I'm talking about is this YOLO and FOMO culture where everybody things they gotta live it up while young or they will lose their youth. I think that will be very detrimental when they grow up and realize what they have done to their health. When in fact, it was their abuse that destroys their bodies in the later years. When if instead you have always taken care of yourself physically, you can be just as healthy in your 40s as you were at 25.

Basically I think that is a mid life crisis. When you hit 40 and realize all of the ""fun"" you had while young because you didn't want to waste your youth, was the exact opposite.

2022-03-10,1646915806,How Did You Rebuild Yourself?,"Hello All,

It's been a crappy few years and it's culminated in the last year.  Basically my mother is in end stage dementia and might as well be catatonic for all it's worth, my brother died, and it seems I've lost damn near every friend I thought I had.

For years, I figured I'd die alone as in no wife/partner, and I was fine with that as I've had a few large groups for friends, some for over twenty years.  But I've seen them all dissolve fairly quickly, and the last group really hurt.  They're not married, don't have at home kids, and honestly don't have anything that would cause distractions I guess?  I was hanging out with them when I got the call my mother had gone non-responsive.  There was no checking on me until I saw them two weeks later when they asked how she was.  Then another two weeks later after someone made a stupid comment I relayed that I'd had to pick up my brother's ashes that week.  Honestly, the responses weren't great and I left shortly after.  Not a single one bothered to reach out to me to check how I was doing, including a man that for the last 24 years I considered a better father figure than either my own father or step-father.  Needless to say that hurt and still does.

So in a little under a year I've lost any family I cared about, and all but two friends.  One local and one twelve hours away.  Extra kudos to the long distance friend who upon finding out about my brother called me nightly for two weeks to check on me.

I'm not stupid, and I'm hopefully not too egotistical.  Unlike my brother, I don't view my own faults as being everyone else's.  So out of all these relationships, there's one main factor, and that's me.  I've done a LOT of soul searched and self examination and there are elements of myself that I want to change.  I'm just not entirely sure how to go about it.  I have started back exercising (although horribly) and started on the keto diet again this week.  So that's two steps in the right direction at least.

But how have you gone through changing aspects of yourself to be a better person?  What did you have to change?  What helped you make these changes?  Any advice would be great, because honestly its freaking daunting.  Hopefully I've realized not too late that dying alone is a bad idea.

Hes in incredible shape for his age, rides his mountain and road bikes daily, and maintains a healthy vegetarian diet, so I think he thinks he can skip out on routine maintenance. He hasnt been to a doctor for anything other than a Covid vaccine in over a year, and I dont trust that frequent urination would be something hed bring up on his own. His father died of a heart attack fairly young, so we dont have him to go off of in terms of what retirement age might look like for my dad, but his older brother nearly died from skin cancer a few years ago.

This would not be the first time hes ignored something ongoing.

2022-05-24,1653419761,Help! Since around puberty (13 years now) my body when I sleep creates a strong odor that goes throughout the entire house or apartment floor Im living in and sticks to my clothes. I cant figure it out and neither have doctors.,"Like the title says, since puberty about the last 13 years (Currently 29M), when I sleep body is been creating a strong odor. Even if Im fall asleep for just 5 minutes the odor occurs. Ive narrowed down to coming from my penis but I think its generating internally and coming out through there. The reason being there are times in the morning when I pee and I can smell the odor in my pee.

It spreads throughout the house or apartment depending on what Im living in. I can wash it off in the morning but it also gets into my clothes and is pretty strong once its in unless I was them. Most people can smell it. I dont know how to describe it its not a smell so bad that you gag or anything, so people that have worked with me are polite, but you still rather not be around it if you have a choice. 

I have been to doctors who have had no idea whats causing it and just kept referring me somewhere else. All STD tests have been negative. All urine tests have found nothing. Physical examinations have turned up nothing. My doctors say based on exams and test I am healthy. My current physical body shape is slightly overweight and getting better but most of the time Ive hovered between in shape and slightly over weight. Im not a gym person or anything. Just running and eating well. 

Ive tried different diets to see if food was causing it. Ive tried different air fresheners (they do nothing but mix with smell), clothes materials, different blankets, otc medications (chlorophyll, vitamin b12 and 2, charcoal, etc) none of it has helped. When its cold when I sleep (ac blasting) the smell mitigates but is still there, I use this at hotels to keep the smell from leaving the room. As far as the rooms me house the smell goes away on its own by noon usually, with the exception of what I was wearing, the bedding, and the room itself (if not ventilation). 

Because of this I havent been able to have roommates, stay at friends house, take overnight trips with friends or have long term relationships (anytime she wanted me to stay the night, Id stay awake all night so the smell wouldnt occur but I can only do that for so long). 

Ive never met anyone with this issue and havent found anything like it in my searches. Curious if anyone here has any ideas what I should do or what may be causing this.",AskMen,18,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMen/comments/uwylix/help_since_around_puberty_13_years_now_my_body/,diet

Question 4: ive chosen a low carb higher protein diet to help me shift some of my weight...what kills me is my absent mindedness and fondness for sweet things. What do you do in situations where you find yourself forgetting what younare doing and gobbling up several chocolate bars?

Question 5: times being as tight as they are quickly becoming, what beard trimming advice/products do you tilhink I could invest in so i can keep my gace looking neat?

2022-04-01,1648831303,When does a crush becomes a friend?,"Hello folks,

&amp;#x200B;

To contextualize my story, I've never been in a relationship (23M). I am consicous I am lacking in romantic love and experiences in the dating world.

A few months ago, I met this girl at the gym who approached me first. We hit it off, had great talks, gym dates and even an actual date. Nothing intimate happened after though. From what I recall, she was quite interested, but at the time for some reason of fear of rejection (I wasn't sure if she was fully interested) I did not ask her out officially to become my girlfriend. Also we had like 2 gym dates and 2 actual dates, not sure how it works, but it seemed too premature for me to ask her out officially -- correct me if I am wrong on this lol.

She had to go back to her country for Christmas and because of the time difference, the texting back and forth was hard so the texts kept getting shorter and shorter but we still caught up from time to time via texts.

She came back a month ago and we caught up in person. From what I can tell, she was still very enthusiastic and interested. We had multiple gym dates, some walk dates (not sure what they are called, but just walking and talking). Nothing intimate happened after those as well.

So a little bit extra info here, she is preparing for a bodybuilding show -- quickly for those who don't know: it's a show that shows off your body and you get judged on that. Thus, she is eating on a low-energy diet in order to lose as much fat as possible. Thus again, she is mostly on low-energy, gets irritated easily etc.

From our actual interaction at the gym, I can tell she is trying her best with me to stay enthusiasts even though she may not feel like it. Texting-wise: some days, we go back/forth a lot but some, we just have a minimal conversation. To add to that, she is also busy with her life -- not sure if this is me trying to make excuses as to why she is not texting as much.

As you can tell by this post, I am clearly still interested and crushing on her, but at this point, I feel like I missed my chance/window to officially ask her out. It's not my first time crushing on someone, but usually when it happens and the other person is not interested, I usually just don't interact with them anymore and I slowly with time forget about them. This time, I see her at the gym almost every day and it's not the kind of relationship that I can simply ghosts easily.

&amp;#x200B;

What I mean by that is we have something going on as great friends, supporter of each other at the very minimum, I can't simply ghosts her...

&amp;#x200B;

What I am planning to do is to go on for those walk dates we've had ( I can't do dinner dates because she has a strict diet and prepares in advance all of her meals) and not confessed outrightly, but ask her if she is interested in going into a relationship, I guess from her response, I'll get hints if she is into me or not?

I also increase the water if I feel like I'm starting to get tipsy at all...but it seems like once that tipsy threshold is reached, it doesn't matter.

2022-12-14,1671037524,Gentleman... How do you make the switch and go vegetarian?,"Gents,

So I know the answer to this is ""eat vegetables and stop eating meat"", but I wanted to know if any of you had been through this recently? What should I look out for, what to be aware of, and any tips or things you might have learned or wish you knew before.

Basically, I've decided I need to shake up my diet. I eat like crap, too much takeout, cookies and candy etc and I've never been able to get a handle on it. I think going vegetarian will force me to eat healthily, change what I cook and make me do it more (which I enjoy) and have a knock-on effect on the rest of what I eat.

The thing is though, if you search for anything along the lines of ""how to go vegetarian"" or ""going vegetarian in your 30's"" or anything like that, the results are all just either lists of recipe ideas or what feels like preachy articles (both for and against) that don't really answer the question.

I didn't want to post on r/vegitarian because it felt like the wrong place and I've always enjoyed reading through this sub and its comments - who better to answer that question than real people?
