1️⃣ Berries: Blueberries, strawberries, raspberries, and blackberries are my favourite. Packed with antioxidants that kick inflammation to the curb and keep me feeling nourished!

2️⃣ Broccoli: Whether steamed, roasted, or added to a stir-fry, broccoli is a very versatile and nutrient-rich vegetable. 🌟🥦

3️⃣ Walnuts: Munching on walnuts and almonds is my go-to snack attack! Not only do they taste amazing, but their healthy fats and antioxidants are my inflammation-fighting warriors! 🥜

4️⃣ Turmeric: Say hello to my little golden secret! Turmeric adds a dash of flavour to my mum's curries that I adore, all the while combating inflammation with its powerful curcumin 🔥

5️⃣ Arugula: Add a peppery kick to your salads with arugula aka rocket! It's a leafy green loaded with vitamins and minerals that help fight inflammation.🚀🌱

6️⃣ Green Tea: Ah, my ultimate hydrating buddy! Sipping on green tea is not only refreshing but those fantastic catechins are on a mission to keep inflammation at bay! 🍵

Alright, now it's your turn! Tell me your favourites and any other anti-inflammatory foods you live by in the comments below! Let's share the goodness! 🌱💬

12;1483301942526880;Nov 23, 2023;Regain Healthy Hair;"Many of us associate genetic baldness with an inevitable fate that awaits us at some point in our lives. However, more and more research proves that the belief is nothing more than a myth. Of course, hair loss can be frustrating and affect our well-being, but it's important that we understand that there are many factors that can affect the process.

Previously, it was believed that genetic baldness is entirely related to the inheritance of genes from parents, especially from the father. However, new research conducted in the field of genetics at many institutes (National Institutes of Health (NIH), University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), Imperial College London, Erasmus Medical Center in Rotterdam and University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine) clearly shows that that it is more complicated than it seems. Scientists have discovered that the causes of baldness are epigenetic. It means that they have nothing to do with genes. Main causes are: nutrient deficiencies, hormonal changes, overuse of certain chemicals, muscle tension, or pathogenic infections of the body. In addition, some medications, especially those for thyroid disease, can also lead to temporary hair loss.

Genetic baldness as the only factor leading to hair loss is a myth that is slowly starting to lose its meaning in the light of new research and discoveries. Therefore, when you received such a diagnosis from a doctor, it means his lack of knowledge and ignorance of the medical literature and the latest research on this topic. It is essential to disseminate reliable information about baldness to dispel outdated and erroneous theories that it is purely genetic.

Many people struggling with hair loss may feel ashamed or insecure about it, which can lead to a loss of self-confidence and affect their quality of life. Therefore, it is important for the public to understand that baldness is not something to be ashamed of, and that there are various methods and natural therapies that can help improve the health of your hair. It is also worth remembering that most cases of baldness are reversible, and hair can grow back with proper treatment and lifestyle changes. Therefore, do not worry that your mother or grandmother had hair loss or your father or grandfather had bends. You don't get that from them. Period. The condition of your hair is up to you. You can make the same mistakes as them and believe in the theory of genetics or bet on conscious changes and regain healthy hair.

That is why I encourage you to start a natural treatment at home against hair loss and hair regrowth right now!

Visit https://regainhealthyhair.com/ download two E-books and learn unique home methods and effective simple recipes that will help you regain healthy hair. I strongly encourage both men and women. If you follow natural methods from e-books you will regain your healthy hair! 🏡💦🌿🤩

If you will have any questions after reading the E-books, do not hesitate to write me a private message on Messenger. Im always here to help 📨😃

However, more and more research proves that the belief is nothing more than a myth. Of course, hair loss can be frustrating and affect our well-being, but it's important that we understand that there are many factors that can affect the process.

Previously, it was believed that genetic baldness is entirely related to the inheritance of genes from parents, especially from the father. However, new research conducted in the field of genetics at many institutes (National Institutes of Health (NIH), University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), Imperial College London, Erasmus Medical Center in Rotterdam and University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine) clearly shows that that it is more complicated than it seems. Scientists have discovered that the causes of baldness are epigenetic. It means that they have nothing to do with genes. Main causes are: nutrient deficiencies, hormonal changes, overuse of certain chemicals, muscle tension, or pathogenic infections of the body. In addition, some medications, especially those for thyroid disease, can also lead to temporary hair loss.

Genetic baldness as the only factor leading to hair loss is a myth that is slowly starting to lose its meaning in the light of new research and discoveries. Therefore, when you received such a diagnosis from a doctor, it means his lack of knowledge and ignorance of the medical literature and the latest research on this topic. It is essential to disseminate reliable information about baldness to dispel outdated and erroneous theories that it is purely genetic.

Many people struggling with hair loss may feel ashamed or insecure about it, which can lead to a loss of self-confidence and affect their quality of life. Therefore, it is important for the public to understand that baldness is not something to be ashamed of, and that there are various methods and natural therapies that can help improve the health of your hair. It is also worth remembering that most cases of baldness are reversible, and hair can grow back with proper treatment and lifestyle changes. Therefore, do not worry that your mother or grandmother had hair loss or your father or grandfather had bends. You don't get that from them. Period. The condition of your hair is up to you. You can make the same mistakes as them and believe in the theory of genetics or bet on conscious changes and regain healthy hair.

That is why I encourage you to start a natural treatment at home against hair loss and hair regrowth right now!

In an unwavering commitment to enhancing health and education in our community, the esteemed Bola Ahmed Tinubu and Babajide Olusola Sanwo-Olu (BAT/BOS) Movement, Badagry, announces the distribution of 10,000 free sanitary pads to ten senior secondary schools in the Badagry area. Aligned with Sustainable Development Goal 3's mission of promoting Good Health and Well-being, this initiative aims to foster hygiene awareness among students and ensure a healthier future.

Scheduled for November 29, 2023, the Movement's executives will visit various schools, including Badagry Senior Grammar School, Topo Senior Grammar School, Ajara Senior Grammar School, Lagos State Model Senior College, and more, distributing these vital sanitary products. The event seeks to instill a culture of hygiene, contributing to the students' overall well-being and fostering a more productive educational environment.

Moreover, alongside the distribution of sanitary pads, the Movement will conduct engaging health talks and discussions for all students across the schools. These sessions aim to provide valuable information on personal hygiene, health maintenance, and empower students with knowledge for a healthier lifestyle.

Hon. Medemaku Samuel, the Coordinator, remarked, ""This initiative represents our commitment to ensuring that our students not only receive quality education but also thrive in a healthy environment. By providing these sanitary pads and imparting health knowledge, we aim to empower and support the young minds of Badagry, promoting a culture of hygiene that will resonate through their lives.""

82;385394883914775;Nov 29, 2023 ;MedCase Studies;"After over 2000 cases of IBS, I can assure you that there are almost no 2 identical cases of IBS.

In my 16-year clinical exploration of IBS, I've discovered something crucial: the classic types of IBS (IBC-C, IBS-D, IBS-M, IBS-U) almost never tell the whole story. Each person's experience with IBS is as unique as their fingerprint, a concept I like to call ""IBSyncrasy."" 🌟

Here's just a glimpse into the diverse world of IBS through some intriguing case studies:

→ Post-Infectious IBS: Ever felt like a stomach bug lasted forever?
→ Post-Cholecystectomy IBS: Dealing with digestive changes post-surgery is more common than you think.
→ Proteus-Predominant IBS: Sometimes, glutamine IS the problem.
→ Pseudomonas-Related IBS: Gluten issues without celiac disease – it's a thing.
→ IBS and Prostatitis: The antibiotic dilemma is real and challenging.
→ Exocrine Pancreatic Insufficiency: IBS can have a metabolic side that's often overlooked.
→ PPI Abuse: Stomach problems can have a domino effect on our bowels.
→ sIgA Deficiency: Our childhood and birth can influence our gut health.
→ SIBO-Dysfunctional MMC: Eating patterns can be more than just lifestyle choices.
→ Pediatric IBS: Early life factors like C-sections and antibiotics play a role.

Each of these stories highlights how varied and complex IBS can be. It's not just about the symptoms; it's about understanding each individual's unique triggers and contexts. 🌿

This journey has taught me that one size does not fit all in the world of IBS. Understanding each one's IBSyncrasy means acknowledging and respecting these differences, and advocating for treatments that are as unique as their stories. 💚

Welcome to #moodMonday — aka a curated weekly moodboard for lovers of slow travel and beautiful moments.

Today’s mood is all about the Mayan jungle of Tulum. This bohemian paradise has it all — but the secret lies in knowing where to go. 👇🏼

You see, Tulum has morphed over the years, transforming into tapestry of contrast that can either enchant or disappoint. It's not just about reaching this destination; it's about discovering the pulse, the heartbeat that sets this coastal gem apart.

Listen closely, I hear plenty of people who go to this place in Mayan Riviera and come back with regrets, unaware of the hidden alcoves that breathe life into this tropical haven. And they have a point: there are certain areas that you really want to avoid if you want the real, authentic experience. What you find in most guides and on social media is a well oiled marketing machine fuelled by foreign investors — I actively avoid those places and tell everyone what I hear from the locals.

In the pursuit of the authentic Tulum, remember: the real gem is often obscured by the glitter. This place is not just a destination; it's an evolving canvas, and I invite you to paint your own narrative amidst its colours.

📖 These are SOME of my fave spots (last pic because I had to) 😍 — working on my full guide in the meantime.

We have already talked once about vegetarian food pairing. It is not that easy as it seems, but we will give you a useful advice. 😉
Vegetarian dishes tend to include more ingredients than a simple steak or piece of fish, so center your pairing around the vegetable that dominates the meal. As with fish or meat, bold flavours demand a bold wine, lighter plates a lighter one. This rule works out also for veggie meals. 🍽️ We wish you a happy cooking. 🥰

Yesterday I binge watched the new Dan Buettner’s documentary on Netflix about the Blue Zones (5 zones in the world where people in general easily reach the age of 100). The serie reminded me of my own journey to one of the Blue Zones. I traveled this far to study and experience the healthy lifestyle of the Okinawans and to learn from them, how to create my own ‘blue zone’ back home.

It was a lifetime experience and I was deeply touched by a beautiful lady, named Toshiko Taira (see the first photo’s) who was running a banana fibre cloth factory in Ogimi village (northern Okinawa). She was 96 at that time and still healthy and very active.

Nowadays I continue to practice a blue zones lifestyle. It helps me staying healthy, happy and fit!

See below some of the @bluezones lifestyle habits:

* Move naturally. Go outside for a walk!
* Have a purpose.
* Practice stress management.
* Don't eat until you're stuffed.
* Swap meat for plants. 🌱
* Enjoy alcohol in moderation (personally I don’t drink alcohol at all!).
* Belong to a community.
* Prioritize family time.
* Keep the faith.

Don’t forget to watch the documentary of @danbuettner on Netflix!

Have a lovely (hopefully plant based) day! 🌱🌸

Imagine waking up every day feeling energized, strong, and excited about your fitness journey. Imagine being strong enough to say no to those unhealthy sodas or extra sugary cookies. Imagine being able to jump off the couch, excited to get moving outside.

You're closer than you think to being fit. You know it's difficult, but do you believe in yourself? Have you achieved anything recently? Well just like that, you can also achieve a healthy body. You can work slowly but steadily towards your health goals by taking the first step.

I lost over 120lbs and I'm going to share with you what I did to do it. I want to help other people do the same, because I am so much happier now that I stuck to my routines, built good habits, and learned to say no to unhealthy behaviors.

You can do the same by first making sure in your mind that you want to lose the fat on your body. Then, when you decide to commit, you must promise yourself that you are committing to a healthier lifestyle. It will be easy once you commit. You can still make mistakes and it won't matter, because you've taken actions to change your habits, and you can get right back up on your feet and continue those good habits.

If you sign up, then I'm going to give you the valuable tips and tricks that changed my life. All for free. Just make sure to be there at the Masterclass on Sunday December 3rd to start your Weight Loss Journey!"

Osteoarthritis can damage any joint but most commonly it affects joints in the hands, knees, hips and spine.

Risk factors include: Older age, obesity, weak muscles, genetics, bone deformities, injury and repetitive stress on the joints.

Symptoms include: Pain, swelling, stiffness, instability, limited range of motion and crackling sounds.

In Osteoarthritis the damage to joints is Irreversible. Staying active and maintaining a healthy weight might slow the progression of the disease and help improve pain and joint function.
